### üîê **PEM Key (Privacy Enhanced Mail format)**

- **Domain**: **Cryptography / Security / SSL/TLS**
    
- **Purpose**: Stores cryptographic keys and certificates (e.g., SSL private keys, public keys, X.509 certificates).
    
- **File Extensions**: `.pem`, `.key`, `.crt`, `.cer`
    
- **Format**: Base64 encoded ASCII with header and footer lines like:
    
    ```
    -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
