## üìù Notes

##### Autoscaling
Kubernetes (K8s) **autoscaling** is the mechanism by which Kubernetes automatically adjusts the number of **pods** or **nodes** in your cluster based on demand. This helps ensure your application is responsive under load and cost-effective during low demand.
##### HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
Kubernetes **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** is a built-in controller that automatically scales the number of pods in a **Deployment**, **ReplicaSet**, or **StatefulSet** based on observed resource usage like CPU, memory, or custom metrics.

###### **How HPA Works**
1. **Metrics Collection**: HPA uses the **Metrics Server** to collect resource usage data.
2. **Target Utilization**: You define a target, such as "average CPU usage should be 60%".
3. **Scaling Logic**: If actual usage exceeds the target, HPA adds pods; if it‚Äôs below, it removes pods.
4. **Periodicity**: HPA checks metrics every **15 seconds by default** and may scale every **30 seconds**.
###### Example: CPU-based HPA
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 60
```

This tells Kubernetes:
- Keep pod count between **2 and 10**.
- Target **60% average CPU usage** across all pods.

###### Key Concepts

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|`minReplicas`|Minimum number of pods to maintain|
|`maxReplicas`|Maximum number of pods to scale up to|
|`metrics`|Defines what metrics to monitor (CPU, memory, custom)|
|`scaleTargetRef`|Points to the workload (e.g., Deployment) to scale|

###### Custom Metrics Support
HPA can also use:
- **Memory usage**
- **Custom application metrics** via Prometheus + Adapter
- **External metrics** like queue length, request rate, etc.
This requires setting up custom metric adapters.

###### Requirements
- **Metrics Server** must be installed and running.
- Target pods should expose CPU/memory requests for metrics collection to work effectively.

###### When to Use HPA?
Use HPA when:
- Your app load varies dynamically.
- You want automatic scaling without human intervention.
- You have predictable resource metrics.

Would you like an example using **memory** or **custom metrics** as well?

##### Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)

The **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** automatically adjusts the CPU and memory requests and limits for containers to help ensure optimal resource utilization and application stability.

###### Purpose of VPA

- Automatically sets optimal resource requests for containers.
- Helps avoid over-provisioning and under-provisioning.
- Useful for workloads with predictable resource usage over time.

###### Key Components
- `VPA Recommender`: Monitors historical resource usage and makes recommendations.
- `VPA Updater`: Deletes and recreates pods with updated resource requests if needed.
- `VPA Admission Controller`: Mutates new pod specs to apply recommended resources at creation time.

###### Modes of Operation
1. **Off**: VPA only makes recommendations, does not apply them.
2. **Auto**: VPA automatically updates pods by evicting and recreating them with new requests.
3. **Initial**: VPA sets recommended values only at pod creation time.

###### VPA CRD (Custom Resource Definition)
```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Auto"
```

---

###### Limitations

- VPA does not work well with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU/memory metrics.
    
- Pods must be restarted to apply new recommendations (except in `Initial` mode).
    
- Not ideal for highly dynamic workloads with bursty traffic.
    

---

###### Best Practices

- Use **VPA in `Off` mode** first to observe recommended values.
    
- Combine **VPA and HPA** only when HPA uses external/custom metrics.
    
- Monitor for unnecessary restarts caused by aggressive update policies.

###### Installation (Example with GKE)

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases/latest/download/vertical-pod-autoscaler.yaml
```

_Note_: Installation method may vary depending on the Kubernetes distribution.
